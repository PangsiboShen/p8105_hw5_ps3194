```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

Read in the table

```{r}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```
Raw data has 52179 observations and 12 variables including: uid,reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race,victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon and disposition. 

```{r}
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )

aggregate_df
```
Can I do a prop test for a single city?

```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom:: tidy()
```

Try to iterate...

```{r}
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

```{r}
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state,estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y =estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2
load data
```{r message= FALSE}
data_1 = read_csv("data/lda_data/con_01.csv")
```
tidy data
```{r message= FALSE}
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data/lda_data")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~ read_csv(.x) )
         ) %>%
  unnest(data) %>%
  separate(path,c("arm","subject_id"),-6) %>%
  mutate(
    arm = case_when(
      arm == "data/lda_data/con_" ~ "control",
      arm == "data/lda_data/exp_" ~ "experimental"
    )
  )

path_df$subject_id = str_replace(path_df$subject_id, ".csv","")

path_df = 
  path_df %>%
  pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("week"),
   names_to = "week",
   names_prefix = "week_",
   values_to = "observation",
  ) %>%
  transform(
    subject_id = as_factor(as.numeric(subject_id)),
    arm = as_factor(arm),
    week = as.numeric(week)
            )
```

plot
```{r}
path_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, gourp = subject_id, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)) +
  ggtitle("spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time")
```
