## Problem 1

Read in the table

```{r}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

```{r}
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```
Can I do a prop test for a single city?

```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom:: tidy()
```

Try to iterate...

```{r}
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

```{r}
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state,estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y =estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2
```{r}
data_1 = read_csv("data/lda_data/con_01.csv")
```
```{r}
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data/lda_data")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/lda_data/", path),
    data = map(......)
         )

read_csv(path_df$path[[1]])
```
